INTRODUCTION
=============

The codes are appropriately named based on their function. They need 
to be run in the following order.

1) ImageAcquisition.m :: Used to grab a snapshot from the webcam.
2) HandSegmentation.m :: Segment the hand from the background.
3) PalmIdentificaton.m :: Identify the bottom of palm, and the centroid.
4) FingerMatrix.m :: Construction of finger boxes to extract the individual
   finger data.
5) FingerDatabase.m :: Contains the database for the finger Identification.
6) FingerIdentification.m :: Identify which fingers are open and which fingers
   are closed.

*) Debug.m :: For debugging purposes.


TRAINING MODE
==============

Set the variable `TRAINING_MODE` in matlab before executing ImageAcquisition.m 
to true to enter TRAINING_MODE.

 In the training mode the second snapshot will be shown for analysis (first 
snapshot is the background). As of now only palm width can be explicitly set
